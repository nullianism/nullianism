# Code of Conduct for Participants v2.1

## Our Commitment
We, as participants, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community harassment-free for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, race, caste, skin color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
- Respecting different opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team via GitHub Issues with the `coc` label. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
